# Next.js App Not Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where the app fails to render correctly.  The page remains blank with no visible errors.

## Bug Report

The `pages/index.js` file contains a simple Next.js component. However, when running the application, the page renders as blank. There are no error messages provided in the browser console or terminal, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

The problem is likely due to a missing or incorrectly configured `pages` directory.  The solution involves verifying the directory structure and ensuring Next.js can find the component to render.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Observe that the application does not render correctly.  The page is blank. 

## Steps to Solve

1. **Verify `pages` directory:** Ensure the `pages` directory exists in the project's root directory and that `index.js` is located within it.
2. **Check for typos:** Double-check for any typos in the file path or file name.
3. **Restart the development server:** Sometimes, a simple restart of the `npm run dev` command can resolve the issue.
4. **Check for other errors:**  Examine the browser's developer console for potential JavaScript errors.

This example is designed to showcase how seemingly simple configuration problems can result in confusing errors without clear messages.  This scenario highlights the importance of carefully checking the project's structure and basic configuration when troubleshooting Next.js.
